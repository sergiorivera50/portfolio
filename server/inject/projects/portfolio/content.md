# Developer Portfolio

## 💡 Motivation

In 2022 I created (and deployed) *sergiorivera.dev*, this website! Although it's not the first time I've created a full-stack application, it's the one where I've learnt the most while building it. Not just in terms of programmatic implementation but in systems design and user experience, both non-trivial topics that I wanted to expand my knowledge on.

My hope with this portfolio is to bring closer what I do with people who might care. Whether you are a potential employer, an academic admissions officer or just a curious developer, I would suggest we [get in contact](mailto:sriveralopez50@gmail.com "Write Email"), as I'm always happy to connect 😁.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, both really useful technologies that I've had the pleasure to learn while doing this. Meanwhile, the backend is a simple Node.js Express application that interfaces with a managed MongoDB database.

Regarding deployment, the client is hosted in a popular platform known as Vercel, and the server is in Heroku. However, the latter will most likely change as I migrate to my own Kubernetes infrastructure (make sure to visit that project, too!).

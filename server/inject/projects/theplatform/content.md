# The Platform Publishing

The Platform is a Web3 project I co-founded in August 2021 as an attempt to refresh the concept of digital publishing, where ownership can be genuinely acquired through leveraging blockchain technologies. The Platform is a collection of smart contracts, each individually operated by a group of creators or artists, where royalties are automatically split among their members.

## üí´ My Involvement

As the Tech Architect, I've worked in many areas of this process (and continue to do so), but they can be broadly categorised into three buckets:
* **Infrastructure**: I've created a set of Ansible playbooks that bootstrap and install a Docker Swarm cluster using Digital Ocean virtual machines (also known as *droplets*), configured our internal applications like Vault and Portainer, and setup an Arweave testnet to preview deployments.
* **Application Development**: Personally, I am in charge of the maintenance of an SDK written to deploy binary formats into the Arweave blockchain, as well as the general open-source strategy we carry out on The Platform. Although we are actively looking for a frontend developer, I have had to involve myself in the implementation of features for our website created in Next.js, more specifically in the business logic for interfacing smart contracts, a practice known as *Web3*.
* **Business Vision**: As every co-owner of The Platform, I attend multiple weekly meetings where we discuss a range of topics, from general business decisions to operations and tech. Although my speciality concerns the technology we develop and use, I've had the great opportunity to learn from other areas of the industry, including business and traditional publishing.

## ü¶Ñ Innovation

What makes The Platform special? Traditionally, smart contracts linked to digital assets, popularly referred to as *NFTs*, have been using a technology known as IPFS. Although reliable, it does not ensure the perpetuity of its content, meaning that while ownership is acknowledged by the blockchain, the asset might disappear if the service is not maintained with funds. A good analogy might be to imagine you own a painting and have ownership proof, but you lost the piece of art; you are left with just the receipt!

However, The Platform changes this and many other aspects of owning digital assets. The binary data is encoded and uploaded to a permanent storage solution like Arweave, which is then linked to the smart contracts, ensuring the perpetuity not just in ownership but in storage too. This enables us to go beyond the traditional marketplace of NFT images to any kind of data that can be represented in binary (including entire websites!).

On September 2022, we launched our first publication  *Quien Te Manda* , which is a freely accessible Web3 book (the first of its kind) created by Editorial Ferragosto, a member of The Platform.

            My name is Sergio. I'm a software developer currently residing in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-justify'>
          Driven by passion and diligence, I've managed to endeavour in many areas of the Computer Science landscape 
          while maintaining a career focus on Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

            My most recent professional experience has been a 13-month internship with <strong>IBM</strong> at Hursley, 
            where I had the privilege to work alongside brilliant minds leveraging technologies such as Kubernetes, Jenkins 
            and the Elastic Stack for the centralisation of logging and monitoring pipelines. During my placement, 
            I co-founded <strong>The Platform</strong>, a new form of online publishing heavily influenced by the Web3 ecosystem, where
            I created many of the open-source tools that our clients now use as well as various internal APIs and the automation of our infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600 text-justify'>
            Currently, I'm working on my final year project at <strong>Swansea University</strong> regarding the use of Generative Adversarial Networks 
            for the generation of synthetic datasets, where I expect to graduate in 2023 with a first-class degree (with honours) in Computer Science.

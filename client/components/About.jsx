            Driven by passion and diligence, I've managed to endeavor on many areas of the Computer Science landscape
            while maintaining a career focus on Artifical Intelligence and Data Science.

            My most recent professional experience has been a 13-month internship with <strong>IBM</strong> at Hursley 
            where I had the privilege to work alongside brilliant minds leveraging technologies such as Kubernetes, Jenkins 
            and the Elastic Stack for the centralisation of logging and monitoring pipelines. It was during my placement that
            I co-founded <strong>The Platform</strong>, a revolutionary new form of publishing for the Web3 ecosystem, where
            I created many of the open-source tools that our clients now use as well as various internal APIs and infrastructure
            requirements.

            At the moment, I'm working on my final year project at <strong>Swansea University</strong> regarding the use of
            conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for the generation of intermediate slices of three-dimensional datasets.
            Such idea comes back from a small exploratory project I created on the summer of 2019, right before starting university,
            where I experimented with the concept of increasing the resolution of CT scans through artificially generated slices. 
            I expect to graduate on 2023 with a first-class (with honours) in Computer Science.
